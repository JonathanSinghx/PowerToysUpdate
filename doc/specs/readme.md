# Specs

All approved specs are inside the [Wiki spec section](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/Specs)

## Spec process

1. A proposed item is either new or requesting additional design 
2. Spec is written inside the Specs folder and a PR happens with feedback.
3. Once spec is signed off, we move it into the [Wiki spec section](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/Specs).

## Thought process behind this

We want a single wholistic for PowerToys. This includes both source code, docs, and specs. At the same time, we want to ensure items have pull requests and feedback.  Since the wiki cannot do PR's, we will do the process above.

This process will allow specs to be image rich but not impact the primary repository's size as more items come online.
